## My process
 I added additional functionality, which is a navigation bar. It works, allowing you to navigate to different sections of the page, not different pages but sections. I know it's not a big deal, but I wanted to add this just for practice. I am working on the other parts as per the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This time, I used the @media property. I am new to responsive design, so it's good that I somehow managed to create a mobile version
