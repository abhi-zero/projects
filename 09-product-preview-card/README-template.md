## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

This time, I used grids the most, and that's what I learned this time.

### Continued development

When I learned and worked with grids, I found that they are very effective. However, I have only learned the basics and have not fully mastered them. I plan to continue learning and using grids in my projects
